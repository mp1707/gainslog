# Comprehensive Design Style Guide

## Gainslog: AI Food Tracker Design Ethos: Focused Motivation

### 1. Look & Feel: "Focused Motivation"

The app will feel like a sharp, intelligent tool that respects your time. The design is built on a foundation of "Focused Clarity". Every screen has a single, clear purpose, eliminating the clutter and decision fatigue of competitor apps. We will use generous spacing and a strong visual hierarchy to make the interface feel calm and breathable.

This clarity is now enhanced by a semantic color system. Key nutritional data is color-coded, allowing for instant, at-a-glance understanding. The experience is brought to life through "Motivational Moments." When you log a meal or hit a nutritional target, the app responds with satisfying, energetic feedbackâ€”a flash of vibrant color, a subtle haptic buzz, or a smooth animation. This transforms the mundane task of tracking into a rewarding experience of relief and accomplishment.

### 2. Color Palette

The palette is built for clarity, energy, and intuitive data recognition. A primary accent color is used for actions, while a dedicated palette is used for nutrients. The base theme remains neutral to allow these colors to stand out.

#### Primary Accent Color

This color is reserved for interactive elements like buttons, active tabs, and key calls-to-action.

| Role                   | Light Mode | Dark Mode |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Accent (Action Purple) | #8A3FFC    | #9E66FF   |

#### Semantic Nutrient Colors

These colors give immediate visual meaning to the app's core data points. They should be used consistently for their respective metrics in all charts, graphs, and progress indicators.

| Role     | Color            | Hex Code (Light) | Use Case                                              |
| -------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Calories | Vibrant Green    | #34C759          | Overall energy, calorie progress bar and totals.      |
| Protein  | Strong Blue      | #0A84FF          | Protein progress bar, stats, and related charts.      |
| Carbs    | Energetic Orange | #FF9F0A          | Carbohydrate progress bar, stats, and related charts. |
| Fat      | Golden Yellow    | #FFD60A          | Fat progress bar, stats, and related charts.          |

#### Theme & Text Colors

The neutral base theme ensures readability and allows the accent and semantic colors to pop.

| Role                         | Light Mode | Dark Mode |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Primary Background           | #F9F9F9    | #000000   |
| Secondary Background (Cards) | #FFFFFF    | #1C1C1E   |
| Primary Text                 | #111111    | #F2F2F7   |
| Secondary Text               | #8A8A8E    | #8D8D93   |
| Borders / Separators         | #EAEAEA    | #38383A   |

### 3. Typography

(This section remains unchanged as the font system is perfectly suitable.)

### 4. Iconography

System: Phosphor Icons

#### Style & Weight

Default State: Use the Regular weight.

Active State: Use the Fill weight to represent a selected or active state (e.g., in a tab bar).

#### Color

Default icons use Primary Text or Secondary Text color.

The Accent color (#8A3FFC) is reserved for key interactive icons or active states.

Semantic colors should not be used for general iconography.

### 5. Spacing & Layout (8pt Grid System)

(This section remains unchanged.)

### 6. Components & Visuals

Buttons (Primary Action): A filled button using the Accent color (#8A3FFC) with white text. Use a corner radius of 12pt for a friendly, rounded feel.

Cards: Use the Secondary Background color with a corner radius of 16pt to feel modern and distinct from the background. They should have a subtle shadow in Light Mode to lift them off the page.

Input Methods: The primary AI input actions (Camera, Voice, Text) should be presented as large, clear tap targets on the main screen, using the Accent color to draw attention.

Data Visualization: Graphs and charts should be clean and simple.

The fill for progress bars must use the corresponding semantic color for that nutrient (e.g., blue for Protein).

In charts, each data series (e.g., Protein) must always be rendered in its assigned semantic color.

### 7. Animation & Motion Guidelines

Animation should be purposeful: enhancing the user experience without being distracting. The guiding principle is "Fluid and Functional, with Moments of Delight.".

#### Functional Motion

Standard, snappy iOS transitions should be used for navigation. Interactions should feel instant and responsive.

#### Delightful Moments

On Log Success: When a meal is logged, the relevant progress bars (e.g., Protein, Carbs) animate smoothly to their new values, filled with their respective semantic colors. This is accompanied by a subtle haptic feedback (a light "tap") to confirm success without needing to look.

On Goal Completion: When a daily goal is met, a non-disruptive celebration occurs. For example, the completed progress bar could emit a brief, soft shimmer using its specific semantic color. This provides a feeling of accomplishment without interrupting the user's flow.
